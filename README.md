# Practice E-commerce Product Listing (Static UI)

A simple practice project that demonstrates a modern, responsive product listing page with filters and cart UI layouts. All product data and UI state are static—no state management or interactivity is implemented.

## Features

- Static product cards with images, prices, discounts, ratings, and category labels.
- Filter sidebar and cart layout **(UI only, non-functional)**.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Clean, modern, showcase-style interface.
